Especially once incentives are terminated, PES risk to be ineffective or even counterproductive. So far, research has produced mixed evidence. We present the first meta-analysis of studies that investigated crowding effects of PES through lab-in-the-field experiments with 2,894 real-world resource users taking 44,540 conservation decisions. On average, PES are successful in increasing conservation behavior and do not crowd out conservation behavior once incentives have been terminated. Although PES demonstrate greater effectiveness in settings where local resource users directly benefit compared to settings where third parties benefit, there is no evidence suggesting systematic differences in crowding effects between these two situations once PES have been terminated. Based on the available experimental evidence, the frequently voiced risk that PES crowd-out conservation, especially once payments are terminated, cannot be substantiated. However, methodological concerns regarding the internal and external validity of current experiments raise questions about the broader applicability of these findings. This paper outlines potential avenues for future research to address these challenges.","tags":["Payments for environmental services","Conservation","Motivations","Behavioral response","Crowding efffects","Crowding-in"],"title":"Payment for ecosystem services and crowding of conservation behavior: A meta-analysis of lab-in-the-field experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Nilgen","Max Burger","Ivo Steimanis","Björn Vollan"],"categories":["Journal Article"],"content":"","date":1732579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732579200,"objectID":"4631a3324dca72bf86464a1c9867dc3d","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/publication/relational_values/","publishdate":"2024-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/relational_values/","section":"publication","summary":"Relational values emphasize the desirable characteristics of nature–society relationships. Unlike instrumental values, relational values have not yet been subjected to monetary quantification, although they may be relevant to environmental policymaking or climate change adaptation decisions which often rely on cost–benefit approximations. This paper explores the quantification of relational values within a contingent valuation scenario both in monetary (one-time donation) and non-monetary terms (Likert-scale, ranking) as well as using a measure that elicits the desired allocation of government budget for adaptation. We conduct two surveys within the context of adaptation projects, aiming to protect the traditional lifestyles of atoll islanders on the Solomon Islands and coastal communities in Bangladesh. In these surveys, we employ two valuation scenarios – one with explicit mention of relational value losses, and one without. Information on relational losses led to no increases in monetary or non-monetary valuation but to a slightly higher allocation of government budget in Bangladesh. We further assess and discuss the validity of our measures, also accounting for respondents’ financial situation. Our findings suggest that emphasizing relational losses could significantly increase disaster management funding in Bangladesh, with a potential 55% budget increase based on our treatment effect. We further discuss the difficulties in quantifying relational values in a context with limited ability to pay and the importance of considering deliberative approaches for ensuring that all dimensions of human-nature relationships are adequately considered in adaptation policy decision-making.","tags":["contingent valuation","relation values","monetary valuation","experiment","atoll ecosystems"],"title":"Pitfalls of monetizing relational values in the context of climate change adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Huber","Anna Dreber","Jürgen Huber","et al.

This fundamental question has been debated among leading scholars for centuries, and more recently, it has been tested in experimental studies yielding a body of rather inconclusive empirical evidence. A potential source of ambivalent empirical results on the same hypothesis is design heterogeneity—variation in true effect sizes across various reasonable experimental research protocols. To provide further evidence on whether competition affects moral behavior and to examine whether the generalizability of a single experimental study is jeopardized by design heterogeneity, we invited independent research teams to contribute experimental designs to a crowd-sourced project. In a large-scale online data collection, 18,123 experimental participants were randomly allocated to 45 randomly selected experimental designs out of 95 submitted designs. We find a small adverse effect of competition on moral behavior in a meta-analysis of the pooled data. The crowd-sourced design of our study allows for a clean identification and estimation of the variation in effect sizes above and beyond what could be expected due to sampling variance. We find substantial design heterogeneity—estimated to be about 1.6 times as large as the average standard error of effect size estimates of the 45 research designs—indicating that the informativeness and generalizability of results based on a single experimental design are limited. Drawing strong conclusions about the underlying hypotheses in the presence of substantive design heterogeneity requires moving toward much larger data collections on various experimental designs testing the same hypothesis.","tags":["competition","moral behavior","metascience","generalizability","experimental design"],"title":"Competition and moral behavior: A meta-analysis of forty-five crowd-sourced experimental designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Max Burger","Marco Nilgen","Ivo Steimanis","Björn Vollan"],"categories":["Journal Article"],"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685577600,"objectID":"241943b9c7d4602dab1659904330deaf","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/publication/relational_cosust/","publishdate":"2023-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/relational_cosust/","section":"publication","summary":"Rising sea levels are projected to affect millions of coastal inhabitants, as climate change is threatening livelihoods all over the world.

PES programs have risen in number. However, claims about perverse impacts after programs end could inhibit their growth. PES end for different reasons (planned duration, budget reduction, issues in implementation) and in different ways (some participants or all). An expressed concern for PES is that receiving payments lowers conservation, after PES end, if participants' intrinsic motivations for conservation are ‘crowded out’ by financial incentives. We test for crowding out by an ongoing program in which some but not all contracts were terminated. We see no evidence of crowding out, since neither the motivations nor the donations for the terminated farmers are significantly different than for non-PES land owners (and this is robust to matching on levels of assets, residence on farm past donation behavior, main economic activity, and participation in collective activities). Our results add evidence from an actual PES to literature questioning the relevance, importance and even sign of crowding effects.","tags":["payments for ecosystem services","crowding","motivations","conservation","Colombia"],"title":"No crowding out among those terminated from an ongoing PES program in Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hjalmar Kühl","Andrée Prisca N.

Kouakou","Björn Vollan","Fabian Leendertz","Ivo Steimanis"],"categories":["Project"],"content":"Landscapes are increasingly dominated by agroforestry, infrastructure and urbanized areas, and wildlife communities are changing dramatically. West African wildlife, including bats, primates, rodents or ungulates host a wide spectrum of pathogens, some of them with zoonotic potential, such as Coronaviruses, Monkeypox and Ebola virus. Some species only remain in marginalized natural habitats, other species thrive and increase in abundance, a situation referred to as post-depletion sustainability. These dynamics have critical consequences of global relevance regarding the reorganization of interactions at the human-wildlife interface and, thus, opportunities for zoonotic disease emergence. Such increasing anthropogenic influences require a shift of thinking from public health towards planetary health, which requires the collaboration of researchers from multiple disciplines and societal stakeholders.\nHabitat co-use and wildlife exploitation (hunting, trading, consuming) take place within a complex social-ecological system (SES) with spatial and temporal variability, social and governance drivers, and multiple-scale processes. Thus, addressing the risks associated with human-wildlife contacts requires transdisciplinary integration of practical and theoretical knowledge to support scientifically valid and socially relevant transformation processes. In terms of ecological factors, higher wildlife host density correlates with the spread of infectious diseases, while outbreak risk in high-biodiversity environments could be lower. Simultaneously, people in the tropics still rely on wild meat as a protein source and build their livelihoods around the wild meat supply chain. Hunting and trading are important for people to earn a living, however, especially in urban areas consumption is not essential. Demand for wild meat has been linked to higher income levels which combined with rapid urbanization threatens biodiversity. Therefore, previous studies of the wildlife supply-demand chain in West Africa suggest to focus on consumers to reduce wildlife exploitation. Wild meat is consumed because of a combination of behavioral factors such as beliefs, cultural traditions, and social norms. Wild meat is seen as a symbol of wealth and status, perceived as fresh, tasty and healthy, and part of people’s cultural identity.\nThese are all factors that could be effectively targeted by behavioral change interventions (BCI) to reduce demand for wild meat. Rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at changing consumer behavior is still lacking even though the behavioral sciences provide an ever-growing toolbox for designing BCI. For choosing the appropriate tools to design a scalable intervention in a given context it is crucial to understand underlying drivers and co-dependencies of targeted behavior. To diagnose the different contexts we will systematically employ the SES framework and the Behavioral Change Wheel (BCW) using both qualitative and quantitative approaches to design effective BCI for altering wild meat consumption and associated risk. Applying the SES and the BCW requires expertise in anthropology and behavioral sciences, but also critical reflection in an inter- and transdisciplinary team of scientists and stakeholders integrating differing knowledge systems, values, and processes.\nThe idea of the proposed project is, therefore, to study human-wildlife contact across social-ecological contexts (SEC) ranging from rural areas close to pristine habitat and degraded landscapes up to flourishing urban centers with focus on wildlife consumers and their capabilities, opportunities, motivations, and environmental contexts for identifying entry points for successful BCI to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence.\nPress release: English \u0026amp; German\n","date":1683849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683849600,"objectID":"ae9f8c84005da8b2207b9e7906e124bd","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/project/behaviorchange/","publishdate":"2023-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/behaviorchange/","section":"project","summary":"Human activities and land-use change are causing major impacts on ecosystems.

We conducted a pre-registered incentivized online experiment with a sample of 769 UK residents to understand better solidarity behavior framed in the context of flooding. In the experiment, participants make costly adaptation decisions that reduce their own risk of endowment loss. Moreover, they can make solidarity transfers to affected partners if unaffected themselves. Participants are matched with a partner who takes adaptation decisions, too. We experimentally vary the adaptation costs of the partner to be either the same (control condition) or heterogenous (known or uncertain). In the control condition, participants show less solidarity with non-adapted partners than with adapted ones. On average, the heterogenous adaptation cost treatments do not significantly affect observed solidarity transfers. Explorative analyses indicate, however, that differences in transfers to adapted and non-adapted partners are mediated by one's adaptation behavior. Under known heterogenous adaptation costs, risk-averse players (who adapted themselves) show as much solidarity with adapted as with non-adapted partners. Overall, the results suggest that information about adaptation cost heterogeneity may promote solidarity after exogenous shocks when people cannot easily adapt proactively.","tags":["climate change","extreme weather events","natural disasters","adaptation","pro-social behavior","online experiment"],"title":"Solidarity under heterogenous adaptation costs: Experimental evidence on coping after climate hazards","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Burger","Ivo Steimanis","Bernd Hayo","Björn Vollan"],"categories":["Analysis"],"content":"Standard economic theory generally assumes preferences to be stable over time.

We find that respondents support migrants who move because of climate change as much as conflict migrants. Acceptance is lowest for migrants who decide to leave for economic reasons, while it is slightly higher in the case of environmental degradation due to local overuse. Strikingly, a sizable share of respondents (25%) would even reject conflict migrants. Respondents who perceive a negative correlation between welfare, crime rates and job opportunities, and the presence of immigrants display lower immigration acceptance for all motives underlying the migration decision. In addition, we find heterogeneous effects depending on the respondents’ gender and political affiliation. Respondents with right-wing party preferences disclose lower acceptance levels for all causes except conflict. Female respondents are more accepting of climate migrants and less of economic migrants than men.

An obstacle that this policy faces is the capacity of recipients to manipulate elections, enabling them to receive aid without giving up power. We report results from an experiment conducted with 64 local leaders in rural Namibia that explore the effect of conditional monetary payments. Conditional payments for democracy are introduced in an environment where each leader selects among three rules for group decision-making: democratic (simple majority), pseudo-democratic (appearing democratic but keeping decision power), and dictatorial (decision by the leader). The group decision is on how to allocate resources between leaders and a set of their villagers (N=384). Leaders make rule choices over three rounds, where we gradually introduce conditional payments for adopting democratic principles, which may include adopting the pseudo-democratic rule). Our results show that without payments, 64 percent of leaders choose the democratic rule. With payments, the number of dictatorial choices decreases at the expense of an increase in pseudo-democratic choices, while the average share of democratic choices is unaffected. These average effects mask substantial heterogeneity depending on leaders’ baseline choices: one-quarter of baseline democrats switches to the pseudo-democratic or even dictatorial rule with conditional payments.\n","date":1636243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636243200,"objectID":"6900c91c32cbf2dadfd2e4dad8eba828","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/workingpapers/paying_for_democracy/","publishdate":"2021-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workingpapers/paying_for_democracy/","section":"workingpapers","summary":"Imbursement of international aid conditional on recipients applying democratic principles has been used as a policy tool to spread democratization for a long time.

Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are now increasingly implemented in developing countries as conservation policy tools providing conditional incentives for conservation efforts. So-called asset-building PES are based on the assumption that environmental-friendly practices are not adopted by land-users due to high initial adoption costs. PES provide incentives for a limited time period to overcome this barrier. After a successful adoption of environmental-friendly practices it is assumed that land-users will stick to them after incentives have been removed. The proposed project will evaluate several long-term aspects of a terminated asset-building PES project in Mozambique: the Sofala community carbon project (SCCP). Between 2003 and 2013 more than 2500 smallholders were contracted to adopt various agro-forestry measures in return for cash payments. In particular, our project will build on a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the impacts of the SCCP with regard to two major criticisms concerning PES:\nEnvironmental effectiveness with respect to deforestation and carbon sequestration. Crowding-out of intrinsic pro-environmental values and social norms of smallholder farmers as well as communities’ capacities for collective action for the sustainable use of natural resources. Our project includes three specific work packages. WP1 evaluates the impact of the SCCP on land-use and land-cover changes with respect to deforestation, slash-and-burn agriculture and agroforestry at the landscape level by applying remote sensing-based methods. WP2 will study and estimate below- and above-ground biomass and carbon stocks of different land-use systems in the project region, which allows us to estimate the overall impact of the SCCP on carbon stocks and sequestration. Our study thus provides one of the first long term impact assessments of an asset-building PES using both data from the air and the ground. WP3 will apply a mixed methods approach including surveys, economic experiments and participatory workshops for analysing the impact of the terminated PES on intrinsic pro-environmental conservation values, self-determination, locus-of-control, collective action and social norms at the community level. If PES crowd-out morality, introducing PES schemes may have negative consequences in other spheres of life as well. This might be especially harmful in small rural communities where pro-social behaviour is instrumental for many other non-market exchanges. Our project delivers a unique and encompassing perspective on the effects of monetary incentives on environmental conservation, human behaviour and its underlying motives in the context of a large-scale terminated PES program, which contributes to further developing a context-specific motivation crowding theory.\n","date":1592564798,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592564798,"objectID":"faa637cea69b2bcb56ccb9e845aa0dc1","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/project/impacted/","publishdate":"2020-06-19T12:06:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/impacted/","section":"project","summary":"The proposed research project will evaluate the impact of a terminated, asset-building PES scheme in Mozambique.

So I was very happy to have the opportunity to do research for my PhD there and for my own, in-depth view on these issues! In mainstream media rising sea-level has become almost synonymous to climate change and global warming. The media is portraying the image of a modern day Atlantis and headlines (see figure below) are pushing the angle towards vanishing islands due to rising sea-levels.\nCommon news headlines for searching ‘pacific islands +sea level rise’ The trigger for most of the above headlines and also a lot of controversy in the scientific community, was the study by Albert et al. from 2016. In this study the authors offer evidence that five Pacific islands were lost to the sea. However, the influence of climate change on these results got exaggerated by the media, as the author himself later admits. In his view, the main take-away message from the study is that “… these observations from the Solomons are a warning of things to come irrespective of if climate change alone caused it or a range of factors”. When reading the article by Albert et al. it becomes clear that these five islands were lost because of a combination of multiple factors; rising sea-level, wave exposure and probably also tectonic activity, and not necessarily attributed to climate change alone. Additionally, it seems that the sampling of islands is rather selective and not representative for Solomon Islands. A recent study by Kench et al (2018, see also by Mann \u0026amp; Westphal, 2014) present findings of shoreline change in all 101 islands of Tuvalu over the past four decades using the same methodology as Albert et al., but undoubtedly a more representative sample. They find that three quarters of Tuvalu’s islands have increased in size, yielding a net gain in land mass of over 70 hectare, which is nearly three percent of the total land mass of Tuvalu. Their results challenge the widespread perceptions of island loss and highlight the importance for alternative, local level adaptation strategies that embrace heterogeneity of atoll islands and their dynamics.\nThe exacerbated representation of scientific findings as done in many news articles, might lead to two important problems. Firstly, trust in science could be undermined when readers find out later that the overstated results were not true. Most likely, they will not blame the journalist who wrote about the issue, but rather the author of the research paper and thereby lose faith in science itself. Scientists, especially in a domain with a lot of uncertainty and importance such as the impacts of climate change, should put more effort into carefully communicating their results to the public.\nThe second concern is with the people living on low-lying pacific islands. In times, where internet is available even on the most remote atoll islands, access to online news is widespread. This is one channel people use to get new information about climatic changes in Solomon Islands. People use these information to form their own expectations and perceptions about climate change. Based on my experience from a low-lying atoll formation, Reef Islands, in Solomon Islands, it seems that many people expect the worst-case scenario of inundation in the near future. They often use a “victim” narrative to explain their dependence on outsiders, such as NGOs, to help them with the consequences of climate change. This is very problematic, as climate change becomes the scapegoat for nearly every problem related to the environment and leads often to inaction. This causes a self-amplifying cycle, where people are unwilling to make investments or take actions and thereby increase their dependence on outsiders. Thus, researchers, journalists and organizations should be careful in the way they craft and communicate messages about climate change. Spreading doomsday scenarios may affect atoll states at a larger scale by increasing dependence on the international community and hindering institutional investments into “atoll futures”.\nThis is not to say that people should not have access to better information about climate change impacts, however it is important to also deliver positive, empowering messages that encourage investments local level adaptation, continued cooperation and responsible stewardship of natural resources. After all, people have been living on these islands for thousands of years. A sea level rise of a few centimeters is unlikely to make all these islands inhabitable in the near future. However, life on these islands will become more difficult. Even more so if communities do not invest in adaption strategies.\nReferences Albert S., Leon J. X., Grinham A. R., Church J. A., Gibbes B.

Leaders are responsible for drafting and enforcing rules concerning resource management and may strongly influence behavior of other resource users. The quality of leadership is also crucial for the success of decentralization reforms that have been initiated across the world in the last two decades and that are often accompanied with the creation of elected councils on the lowest level of governance responsible for managing public goods and natural resources. Decentralization and democratization reforms may improve local public good provision, but they are also prone to power abuse, nepotism, arbitrary rule enforcement, and other forms of misbehavior of leaders that may undermine trust and cooperation among community members and impede sustainable resource management.\nThis study provides experimental evidence from 32 communities in Northern Namibia on the nepotistic use of punishment and procedural fairness of local leaders. In the study area, decentralization reforms have created a coexistence of democratically legitimized leaders responsible for water management and traditional authorities, who inherit their position and have the power to allocate land to resource users. In addition, the project investigates whether leadership strategies and leaders’ personality traits have explanatory power for the real-life performance of leaders and whether local villagers’ perceptions about resource availability have an impact on the election of different types of leaders. The results of this project contribute to the broad strands of literature on leadership, decentralization policies and common-pool resource management.\nThe study was carried out in the Ohangwena region in northern Namibia in summer 2014. In this area, the majority of inhabitants, about 80% of participants, are pastoralists who strongly depend on the availability of grazing and water resources. Access to and the management of these resources is regulated both by traditional and democratically elected leaders. The study employed three local research assistants who are native Oukwwanyama, born and raised in the study area, but currently enrolled at the University of Namibia (UNAM) in Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia. We use a combination of lab-in-the field experiments and surveys to answer our research questions:\nIs ’nepotism’ more prevalent under democratically legitimized or traditional forms of leadership?

While people have historically abandoned places with harsh conditions, the scale of these flows is expected to increase dramatically as a result of climate change. Environmental migrants are individuals forced to migrate from their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local environment compromising their well-being or secure livelihood.\nThere is consent among researchers that climate change will result in increasing migration and even the need to resettle entire populations. Many environmental scientists believe that the sea level will rise as a consequence of global warming and the Solomon Islands will be heavily affected by such an occurrence.\nThe “Shadow of the future” project examine, how people are likely to change their behavior in light of future climate changes, and build scenarios about potential responses, but also about their exposure to risk. The research project will identify the human reaction to severe impacts of climate change by combining an original comparative research design and the use of economic experiments, survey methods and modelling techniques. With this combination we aim to analyze how risk perception, preferences and behavior of people change with the prospect of being severely affected by climate change and whether and how the preferences translate into choices for short- and medium adaption strategies. Thus we examine the behavioral motives of potential climate refugees.\nOur comparative design will sample people who have been affected by different degrees of sea level rise on the Solomon Islands. We sample people from low lying atolls, which are at the maximum 2m above the sea level and from higher lying islands, as well as people who already migrated from the atolls.\n","date":1573038398,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573038398,"objectID":"e335eca8f8e7ef622b8ab8a7ffafee41","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/project/sotf/","publishdate":"2019-11-06T12:06:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sotf/","section":"project","summary":"The aim of the project is to better understand the climate change migration nexus.

As a response to climate change impacts in island communities, such as sea level rise, discounting the future can be a rational response due to increased stress on natural resources and uncertainty about whether future generations will have the same access to the same resources. By incorporating systematic responses of discount rates into models of resource conservation, realistic expectations of future human responses to climate change and associated resource stress may be developed. This paper illustrates the importance of time discounting through a theoretical agent-based model of resource use in island communities. A discount rate change can dramatically change projections about future migration and community-based conservation efforts. Our simulation results show that an increase in discount rates due to a credible information shock about future climate change impacts is likely to speed resource depletion. The negative impacts of climate change are therefore likely to be underestimated if changes in discount rates and emerging migration patterns are not taken into account.","tags":["ABM","Discounting","Sea-level rise"],"title":"Influence of sea level rise on discounting, resource use and migration in small-island communities: an agent-based modelling approach","type":"publication"}]
