      <description>&lt;p&gt;Standard economic theory generally assumes preferences to be stable over time. However, major events in peoples’ lives – such as natural disasters – have the potential to affect peoples’ preferences. Recently, the number of studies examining the temporal stability of individuals’ preferences increased markedly, suggesting increasing doubt about the appropriateness of this standard microeconomic assumption. This doubt is also fostered by Chuang and Schechter’ (2015) extensive literature review on the stability of preferences in general. In this survey, little attention is paid to the stability of individuals’ social preferences, which is the focus of our study. Concentrating on violent conflicts, Bauer et al. (2016) show how social preferences can be altered through such life-changing events. The focus of our study is on examining the impact of natural disasters on solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our experimental design is based on a combination of the social dilemmas studied in Blanco et al. (2018) and Gross &amp;amp; Dreu (2019). This design extends our previous studies of the insider-outsider interactions to a new social dilemma. Insiders can now choose between adaptive measures (protecting only themselves) and mitigation measures (protecting the whole group). While the group solution is the socially efficient outcome (as the outsiders do not lose their resources), insiders have incentives to invest into the individual solution to protect themselves from risk of free-riding from other insiders. Outsiders fully rely on insiders to collectively choose mitigation measures to protect them from losing their resources, as they cannot participate in any adaptation or mitigation efforts themselves. But outsiders can send transfer donations to insiders, aiming at compensating them for the efforts to invest into the group solution.&lt;/p&gt;
