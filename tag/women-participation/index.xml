      <description>&lt;p&gt;Games as experiential learning interventions receive increasing attention. We conducted experiential learning games with 784 participants around the management of a local public good in 56 randomly selected communities in rural India. We find a significant positive impact on sustainable water management two years after the intervention compared to a control group of 27 randomly selected communities. Additional analysis indicates that achieving impact was more likely if more women were participating in the games. The results highlight the potential of experiential learning as sustainability intervention, especially when including women in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
